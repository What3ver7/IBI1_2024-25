# Define a list called splice_combinations containing 'GTAG', 'GCAG', and 'ATAC'.
# Ask the user to input a splice combination and convert the input to uppercase and strip any whitespace.
# While the user input is not in the splice_combinations list:
# Print an error message telling the user the input is invalid.
# Prompt the user to enter the splice combination again.
# Create an output file name using the valid splice combination and the suffix '_spliced_genes.fa'.
# Open the input file named 'Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.cdna.all.fa' in read mode.
# Open the output file using the previously generated name in write mode.
# Initialize an empty list called current_gene to store the current gene name.
# Compile a regular expression pattern to search for TATA box sequences like TATAAA, TATATA, etc.
# Compile another pattern to extract gene names from lines that contain 'gene:<name>'.
# Compile a splice site pattern using the first two and last two letters of the chosen splice combination.
# For each line in the input file:
# If the line contains a gene name:
# If there is a previous gene and its corresponding sequence stored:
# Join the sequence lines into one continuous string.
# If the splice site pattern is found in the sequence:
# Find all matching splice sequences.
# Initialize a counter to count the number of TATA boxes.
# For each splice sequence found:
# If the splice sequence contains a TATA box pattern:
# Count how many TATA boxes are found and add to the counter.
# Write the gene name and the number of TATA boxes to the output file.
# Write the original gene sequence to the output file.
# Update current_gene with the new gene name found.
# Clear the current_sequence list to start collecting new sequence lines.
# If the line does not contain a gene name, add it to the current_sequence list.
# After the loop, handle the last gene in case it was not processed:
# Join the remaining sequence lines into one string.
# If the splice pattern is found in the sequence:
# Search for TATA boxes and count them.
# Write the last geneâ€™s information and sequence to the output file.
